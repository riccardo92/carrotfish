# Laminair

Laminair, a combination of the words ***laminar*** and ***air*** (as in, non-turbulent air), is an Airflow plugin that aims scheduling and managing DAGs easier. It provides a calender-like visual interface as overview for all DAG schedules and provides a tool to determine a new DAG's schedule taking into account various conditions. Sometimes, scheduling DAGs is not unrestrained and we need to take into account some boundary conditions (e.g. limited network traffic time frames). This can be become quite a burden for a large number of DAGs.
